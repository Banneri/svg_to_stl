This code makes some kind of a stamp from svg files.

There is a limit how complex svg files this can handle. It can handle atleast 136 polygons.
Measurements are in millimeters (mm).

Importing svg doesn't show anything on the loading bar.

You can adjust extrusion height and base thickness in mm. 5 mm and 2 mm ar there by default.
The loading bar might seem it got stuck, but just wait for it. Processing batches is kinda slow for bigger files.
